<h1>Honda Accord: Complete Model Guide and Buyer Resources</h1>
<section>
<h2>Understanding the Honda Accord Lineup Across Generations</h2>
<p>The Honda Accord has maintained its position as one of America's best-selling midsize sedans for over four decades. From the 2008-2010 eighth generation models still running strong on used car lots to the latest 2024-2025 tenth generation vehicles featuring hybrid powertrains and advanced safety tech, this sedan continues evolving while keeping its core values intact. The current generation launched in 2018 received significant updates for 2023, including a complete redesign that brought sharper styling and improved interior materials.</p>
<p>For buyers considering used models, the 2008-2010 Accord generation represents exceptional value. The 2009 Honda Accord, for instance, came with either a 177-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 271-horsepower 3.5-liter V6. These models are now available for $6,000-$12,000 depending on mileage and condition. The 2010 Honda Accord added minor refinements and improved fuel economy ratings, achieving 23/34 mpg city/highway with the four-cylinder engine. According to the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, these models earned five-star overall safety ratings, making them solid choices for budget-conscious families.</p>
<p>The 2024 Honda Accord Sport has become particularly popular, featuring a turbocharged 1.5-liter engine producing 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. The Sport trim adds 19-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, and dual exhaust outlets. Pricing starts at approximately $29,000. The sonic grey pearl exterior color has emerged as a favorite among buyers, offering a sophisticated metallic finish that hides minor scratches better than lighter colors. This particular shade costs an additional $395 but maintains resale value exceptionally well.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the 2025 Honda Accord Sport continues the momentum with standard Honda Sensing safety features and an available hybrid powertrain. The 2025 Honda Accord Hybrid Sport combines the 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with two electric motors, delivering a combined 204 horsepower and an EPA-estimated 48 mpg combined. This represents a 50% improvement over the non-hybrid Sport model's 32 mpg combined rating.

<h2>The Case for Honda Accord AWD: What Buyers Need to Know</h2>
<p>One frequent question from shoppers is whether the Honda Accord offers all-wheel drive. Currently, Honda does not manufacture an AWD Honda Accord. The sedan remains front-wheel drive across all trim levels and model years. This decision stems from Honda's focus on fuel efficiency, interior space, and cost management. Adding AWD would increase the base price by approximately $2,000-$2,500 and reduce fuel economy by 2-3 mpg combined.</p>
<p>However, Honda addresses the all-weather capability gap through other vehicles in their lineup. The Honda CR-V and Honda Passport offer AWD options for buyers prioritizing traction in snow and rain. The Accord compensates for its FWD layout with Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), traction control, and available snow-rated all-season tires. According to testing by the <a href="https://www.iihs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a>, the Accord with proper winter tires performs comparably to AWD sedans with all-season tires in most winter conditions.</p>
<p>For buyers absolutely requiring AWD in a midsize sedan, competitors include the Subaru Legacy (standard AWD starting at $24,000), Toyota Camry AWD (available on select trims for $1,400 extra), and Nissan Altima AWD. These alternatives sacrifice some fuel economy but gain confidence in challenging weather. The Camry AWD achieves 32 mpg combined compared to the Accord's 35 mpg in comparable trim levels. Our <a href="/about-us">about page</a> provides more context on how the Accord fits within the broader midsize sedan market.</p>

<h2>Finding Used Honda Accord Models: Market Insights and Pricing</h2>
<p>Searching for a used Honda Accord for sale near me yields thousands of results across the United States, reflecting the model's popularity and availability. Approximately 350,000 Accords sell annually in the US according to automotive sales data, creating a robust used market. The key is understanding which model years offer the best value proposition and which to avoid due to known issues.</p>
<p>The 2008 Honda Accord stands out as a budget-friendly option, typically priced between $5,000-$9,000 with 120,000-180,000 miles. These vehicles often have remaining service life since Honda engines commonly exceed 200,000 miles with proper maintenance. However, buyers should inspect for transmission issues, particularly in V6 models, as some 2008 units experienced premature transmission failure. The four-cylinder automatic models prove more reliable. Always request maintenance records and consider a pre-purchase inspection from an ASE-certified mechanic.</p>
<p>The 2023 Honda Accord Hybrid represents the opposite end of the spectrum, offering near-new vehicles with remaining factory warranty. These models typically sell for $28,000-$34,000 with under 20,000 miles, representing savings of $3,000-$5,000 compared to new. The hybrid powertrain delivers 48 mpg combined, translating to fuel savings of approximately $600 annually compared to the non-hybrid model when driving 12,000 miles at $3.50 per gallon. The Environmental Protection Agency provides detailed fuel economy data showing the hybrid's efficiency advantages across various driving conditions.</p>
<p>When evaluating any Honda Accord for sale, check the vehicle history report through the <a href="https://vehiclehistory.bja.ojp.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Motor Vehicle Title Information System</a> to verify title status and major accidents. Common inspection points include brake pad thickness (should exceed 4mm), tire tread depth (minimum 4/32 inch), and fluid conditions. The Accord's timing chain design eliminates the need for timing belt replacement, reducing long-term maintenance costs by approximately $800-$1,000 compared to belt-equipped competitors.</p>

<h2>2024 and 2025 Honda Accord Sport: Performance and Value Analysis</h2>
<p>The 2024 Honda Accord Sport occupies the sweet spot in the lineup, balancing performance enhancements with reasonable pricing. Starting at approximately $29,000, the Sport trim adds $2,000 over the base LX but includes equipment worth considerably more. The 19-inch alloy wheels alone retail for $1,200 as accessories, while the sport-tuned suspension improves handling without compromising ride quality. The dual exhaust system is functional, not just cosmetic, reducing backpressure and contributing to the engine's responsive character.</p>
<p>Performance testing shows the Accord Sport accelerates from 0-60 mph in 7.3 seconds with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, competitive with the Mazda6 (7.5 seconds) and significantly quicker than the Toyota Camry SE (8.2 seconds). The continuously variable transmission (CVT) simulates gear changes through preset ratios, providing a more engaging driving experience than typical CVT drones. Fuel economy remains impressive at 29 mpg city and 37 mpg highway, achieving 32 mpg combined in real-world testing.</p>
<p>The sonic grey Honda Accord has become particularly sought-after in Sport trim, combining the athletic styling with a sophisticated color that appeals to professional buyers. This metallic grey shows minimal dirt between washes and photographs exceptionally well. Resale data from automotive valuation guides indicates that grey and silver Accords retain 58% of their value after three years, compared to 54% for white models and 52% for black vehicles. The grey Honda Accord also shows scratches and swirl marks less readily than darker colors.</p>
<p>For 2025, Honda enhanced the Accord Sport with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, addressing a previous complaint. The 2025 Honda Accord Hybrid Sport debuts as a new variant, combining Sport styling with the hybrid powertrain's efficiency. At approximately $33,000, this model costs $4,000 more than the gas Sport but delivers 48 mpg combined versus 32 mpg, creating annual fuel savings of $700-$800 for drivers covering 15,000 miles annually. The <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Energy's fuel economy website</a> provides calculators to determine individual savings based on driving patterns.</p>
