<details>
<summary>How much does a new Honda Accord cost?</summary>
<p>A new 2024 Honda Accord starts at approximately $27,000 for the base LX trim with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine. The Sport trim begins around $29,000, the EX-L at $32,000, and the top-tier Touring at $38,000. The 2024 Accord Hybrid adds roughly $2,000-$3,000 to equivalent trim levels, with hybrid pricing starting near $29,000 for the base hybrid and reaching $40,000 for the Hybrid Touring. These prices represent manufacturer's suggested retail prices before destination charges (typically $1,095), dealer fees, taxes, and registration. Many dealers charge market adjustments during high-demand periods, potentially adding $1,000-$3,000 to popular configurations like the Hybrid Sport. Conversely, Honda occasionally offers incentives including 0.9% APR financing, $500-$1,000 customer cash, or lease deals around $299-$349 monthly with approximately $2,500 down payment. For current 2025 models, expect pricing to increase by $500-$1,000 across the lineup.</p>

<details>
<summary>Is the Honda Accord reliable?</summary>
<p>Yes, the Honda Accord consistently ranks among the most reliable midsize sedans based on data from <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">J.D. Power</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Consumer Reports</a>, and <a href="https://repairpal.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RepairPal</a>. Consumer Reports rates the Accord at 4 out of 5 for predicted reliability, above the segment average. J.D. Power awards the Accord scores of 82-86 out of 100 for quality and reliability across recent model years. RepairPal gives the Accord a reliability rating of 4.5 out of 5.0, ranking it first among 24 midsize sedans. Annual maintenance costs average $400-$500, significantly below the midsize sedan average of $650. Common issues are minimal, though some 2018-2019 models experienced infotainment system freezing (addressed through software updates) and 2013-2015 models had CVT transmission concerns in four-cylinder variants. The Accord's engines routinely exceed 200,000 miles with proper maintenance, and many owners report trouble-free operation beyond 250,000 miles. The model's strong reliability contributes to excellent resale values, typically retaining 55-60% of original value after three years.</p>

<div class="card">
<details>
<summary>What problems do Honda Accords have?</summary>
<p>While generally reliable, Honda Accords have experienced specific issues across different generations. The 2008-2010 models occasionally suffered premature transmission failure in V6 variants, with some units failing between 80,000-120,000 miles. The 2013-2015 generation experienced CVT judder and hesitation in four-cylinder models, though Honda extended warranties to 8 years/125,000 miles for affected vehicles. The 2018-2019 models had infotainment system freezing and slow response times, resolved through software updates. Some 2018-2020 Accords exhibited excessive oil dilution with the 1.5-liter turbo engine in cold climates, prompting a software update to modify engine warm-up procedures. The 2023 models occasionally show paint imperfections on the hood and roof panels. Additionally, earlier Accords (2003-2007) developed brake rotor warping, causing steering wheel vibration during braking. Most issues affect specific model years rather than the entire lineup, and Honda typically addresses problems through technical service bulletins or extended warranties when patterns emerge.</p>
</details>
</div>

<div class="card">
<details>
<summary>How long do Honda Accords last?</summary>
<p>Honda Accords routinely last 200,000-300,000 miles with proper maintenance, translating to 15-20 years for average drivers covering 12,000-15,000 miles annually. The engine and transmission represent the most durable components, with many original powertrains exceeding 250,000 miles without major repairs. Critical factors affecting longevity include regular oil changes (every 5,000-7,500 miles), transmission fluid replacement (every 60,000-90,000 miles), and timely maintenance of the cooling system. Accords benefit from timing chain designs rather than timing belts, eliminating a major maintenance expense and potential failure point. According to automotive longevity studies, approximately 2.5% of Accords reach 200,000 miles, significantly higher than the industry average of 1.2%. Rust protection varies by region, with models in salt-belt states showing body corrosion after 10-15 years, while vehicles in dry climates maintain structural integrity for 20+ years. The key to maximizing Accord lifespan involves following Honda's maintenance schedule, addressing issues promptly, and avoiding aggressive driving that stresses mechanical components.</p>

</div>

<div class="card">
<details>
<summary>Does the Honda Accord come in all-wheel drive?</summary>
<p>No, Honda does not offer all-wheel drive on the Accord. All model years and trim levels feature front-wheel drive exclusively. Honda made this decision to prioritize fuel efficiency, interior space, and cost management. Adding AWD would increase vehicle weight by 150-200 pounds, reduce fuel economy by 2-3 mpg, raise the starting price by approximately $2,000-$2,500, and slightly diminish trunk space. For buyers requiring AWD in a Honda sedan, no current options exist within the brand. However, Honda offers AWD on crossovers and SUVs including the CR-V, Passport, and Pilot. Competitors offering AWD midsize sedans include the Subaru Legacy (standard AWD), Toyota Camry (optional AWD on select trims), and Nissan Altima (optional AWD). The Accord compensates for FWD limitations through advanced traction control, vehicle stability assist, and available winter-rated all-season tires. With proper tires, the FWD Accord performs adequately in snow and rain for most drivers, though it cannot match AWD capability in extreme conditions or off-pavement situations.</p>
</details>
</div>

<div class="card">
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between Honda Accord Sport and EX-L?</summary>
<p>The Honda Accord Sport and EX-L target different buyer priorities, with Sport emphasizing performance aesthetics and EX-L focusing on luxury and comfort. The Sport trim includes 19-inch black alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension, dual exhaust outlets, a rear spoiler, black exterior trim, sport pedals, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with red stitching. It starts around $29,000. The EX-L trim, priced at approximately $32,000, features 17-inch alloy wheels, standard suspension tuning, leather-trimmed seats with heating, an 8-way power driver's seat with lumbar support, HomeLink garage door opener, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a premium 8-speaker audio system. The EX-L prioritizes comfort with softer suspension tuning that absorbs bumps better, while the Sport offers sharper handling and more aggressive styling. Both trims include Honda Sensing safety features, LED headlights, and the same 1.5-liter turbocharged engine producing 192 horsepower. Buyers seeking a sportier appearance and firmer ride prefer the Sport, while those wanting maximum comfort and premium materials choose the EX-L. Neither is objectively better; the choice depends on whether you value performance aesthetics or luxury amenities.</p>
</details>
</div>

<div class="card">
<details>
<summary>Are older Honda Accords worth buying?</summary>
<p>Older Honda Accords, particularly 2008-2012 models, represent excellent value for budget-conscious buyers when properly evaluated. These vehicles typically cost $6,000-$13,000 with 100,000-150,000 miles remaining, offering reliable transportation at a fraction of new car prices. The eighth-generation Accords (2008-2012) feature durable powertrains that commonly exceed 200,000 miles, spacious interiors, and strong safety ratings. However, buyers should prioritize four-cylinder models over V6 variants due to transmission reliability concerns in V6 automatics from this era. Essential inspection points include transmission operation (smooth shifts without slipping), engine oil consumption (some 2008-2011 engines burn oil), suspension components (bushings wear around 120,000 miles), and brake system condition. Request complete maintenance records showing regular oil changes and timing chain tensioner replacement if applicable. The 2013-2015 generation offers more modern styling and better fuel economy but carries CVT transmission concerns in four-cylinder models. For buyers seeking maximum reliability in older Accords, the 2016-2017 models provide the best balance of affordability ($16,000-$22,000), modern features including Apple CarPlay, and proven mechanical durability with minimal known issues.
